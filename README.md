# Multivariate-Analysis-of-GDP-and-Life-Expectancy-Trends
I recently completed an enriching project investigating relationships between GDP per capita and life expectancy using a longitudinal dataset. 

Through this analysis, I applied various multivariate data analysis techniques:
 ‣ Exploratory Data Analysis - Visualizations of macroeconomic and mortality trends
 ‣  Principal Component Analysis - Variation interpretation and component retention
 ‣  Multidimensional Scaling - Data representation via dimension reduction
 ‣  Hypothesis Testing - Assessment of cross-continent differences
 ‣  Linear Discriminant Analysis - Country continental classification
 ‣  K-Means Clustering - Grouping based on growth trajectories
 ‣  Hierarchical Clustering - Recursive data partitioning using inter-cluster metrics
 ‣ Linear Regression - Life expectancy forecasting from GDP

Completing this end-to-end process enabled me to demonstrate proficiency in crucial statistical, machine learning and visualization skills while also gaining valuable domain insights into economic and health interconnections.
